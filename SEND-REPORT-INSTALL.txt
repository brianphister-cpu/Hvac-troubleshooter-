This package was updated to include a 'Send Report' button inside the History box, next to the Export CSV button.
No other files were changed except:
  - index.html: added one line to load send-report.v74b.smart.js at the end of the body
  - send-report.v74b.smart.js: new file

Before using, open send-report.v74b.smart.js and set:
  const REPORT_TO     = 'you@yourcompany.com'; // <-- set your email address
  const SHARED_SECRET = '';                    // <-- set if your relay requires it

Everything else (refrigerant list, Diagnose, Î”T rules, PT, cycle diagram) remains unchanged.
